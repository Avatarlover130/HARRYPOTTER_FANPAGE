      <p class="p_modal">Gryffindor is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was
        founded by Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students possessing
        characteristics he most valued, such as courage, chivalry, and determination, to be sorted into his house.
        The emblematic animal is a lion, and its colours are scarlet and gold. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also
        known as "Nearly Headless Nick" is the House ghost. Gryffindor corresponds roughly to the element of fire, and
        it is for this reason that the colours scarlet and
        gold were chosen to represent the house. The colour of fire corresponds to that of a lion as well, with
        scarlet representing the mane and tail and gold representing the coat. </h2>

      <p class="p_modal">Slytherin is one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by
        Salazar Slytherin. In establishing the house, Salazar instructed the Sorting Hat to pick students who had a
        few particular characteristics he most valued. Those characteristics include cunning, resourcefulness,
        leadership, and ambition. Many Slytherin students tend to clique together, often acquiring leaders, which
        further exemplifies Slytherin's ambitious qualities. Examples of these include Draco Malfoy's gang, Merula
        Snyde's gang, Pansy Parkinson's gang and the Death Eaters.

        The founder highly valued and favoured pure-blood students and the Sorting Hat admitted that it can be a factor
        when being sorted.Students of any blood status can be placed in the house. However, a Muggle-Born
        student from that house is considered to be quite rare.</h2>

        wisdom. The emblematic animal symbol is an eagle, and blue and bronze are its colours.The Head of Ravenclaw
        is Filius Flitwick,and the house ghost is the Grey Lady, real name Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of
        Rowena.

        Ravenclaw corresponds roughly to the element of air,and it is for that reason that the House colours were
        chosen; blue and bronze represent the sky and eagle feathers respectively, both having much to do with air.
        The Ravenclaw points hourglass contains blue sapphires.</h2>

      <p class="p_modal">Hufflepuff was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its
        founder was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses;
        valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its
        members. The emblematic animal was a badger, yellow and black were its house colours. The Head of
        Hufflepuff was Pomona Sprout, and the Fat Friar was the House's patron ghost.

        Hufflepuff corresponded roughly to the element of earth, and it is for that reason that the House colours
        were chosen: yellow represented wheat, while black was emblematic of soil. The Hufflepuff point hourglass
        contains yellow diamonds.Students sorted into Hufflepuff often demonstrate exceptional abilities in
        Herbology, owing to their correspondence to earth.</h2>
